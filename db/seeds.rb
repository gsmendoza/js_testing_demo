# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:

Song.create(:artist => 'Mississippi John Hurt', :title => 'Candyman')
Song.create(:artist => 'Robert Johnson', :title => 'Cross Road Blues')
Song.create(:artist => 'Blind Lemon Jefferson', :title => 'Hot dogs')
